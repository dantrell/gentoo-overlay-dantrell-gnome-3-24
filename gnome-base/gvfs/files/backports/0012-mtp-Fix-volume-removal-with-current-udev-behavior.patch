Subject: [PATCH 12/13] mtp: Fix volume removal with current udev behavior

UDev events for devices without ID_MTP_DEVICE property are ignored.
Although ID_MTP_DEVICE seems don't have to be set for device when removing
and thus the volume is not removed. Let's ignore ID_MTP_DEVICE when removing.

(cherry picked from commit 4fe3b0f8d24851145b5ceae10eb3181b2340466b)
